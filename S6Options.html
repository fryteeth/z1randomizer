Week 7: 1 bonus point per key you have left at the end of the run, grabbing the anykey means zero bonus points, shop keys don't count and have to be substracted from the final count <BR>
Week 8:  4 bonus points per damageless dungeon, you only got one attempt, no retrying, no resetting, no second chance. Any hit taken is considered as damage taken, even if it doesn't show up on your health bar. Exceptions are bubbles and self-damage (candle boosts are ok!). You have to grab at least one important thing (item, heart container, triforce piece) from the dungeon to claim its points.<BR><BR>
Special Rules: Hexaforce - Every week there's a few tasks you can do to score additional points. Example tasks: see both items in 9, visit every OW cave, don't take damage in a dungeon, and many more.<BR>
